      <h2 className="title-with-gradient">WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small file for storing and retrieving information, generally made up of alphanumeric
      characters (cf. letters and numbers), deposited by a web server on the computer or electronic terminal
      of the User of the site to send state information to said browser and likewise obtain such information
      back from the browser. The status information can be for example a session identifier, a language, an
      expiration date, a response domain, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies usually make it possible to obtain certain information on the browsing habits of the User, his
      computer or his terminal, in particular in order to improve the content and the service offered by the
      site in question, to know the traffic of said site and to provide Internet Users with personalized
      services.
      </p>
      <p>The notion of cookies covers all types of tracers or other similar technologies, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP Cookies;</li>
        <li>
          but also the use of other techniques:
          <ul>
            <li>“local shared objects” sometimes called “Flash Cookies”;</li>
            <li>“local storage” implemented within HTML 5;</li>
            <li>identifications by calculating the fingerprint of the terminal (“device fingerprinting”);</li>
            <li>identifiers generated by operating systems (whether advertising or not: IDFA, IDFV,

            <li>hardware identifiers (MAC address, serial number or any other identifier of a device);</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>"Functional" cookies not subject to User consent
      Functional Cookies, ie those whose sole purpose is to allow or facilitate electronic communication on,

      express request of the User of a site, are exempt from the need for the publisher of a site to request the
      User's consent for their installation.
