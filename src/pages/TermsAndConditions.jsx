        <p>Purpose. These T&C govern the contractual relationship between META LEGENDS and its Users and Clients in the context of the use of the Website and the Application and the purchase of NFTs.</p>

        <p>Entire agreement. The T&C are accessible at any time on the Website and the Application. They represent the entire agreement between META LEGENDS and the Client/User and supersedes, any other prior version or agreement between the parties. They come into effect from the update date indicated at the top of this document. The T&C apply to the exclusion of all other conditions and constitute all of the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of their contractual relationship. No specific condition, at the initiative of the Client/User, may be added to and / or substituted for the present T&C.</p>

        <p>However, the Client is duly informed that the Company may rely upon third-party administered websites in order to provide the Service (i.e.: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/">https://opensea.io/</a> for the purchase of NFTs). In this case, the general terms and conditions of these platforms will take precedence over these T&C, for the aspects of the contractual relationship between the Clients and the Company they administer.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, META LEGENDS reserves the right to provide special conditions for certain Services, special offers, special guarantees, etc., which shall be provided to the Client in connection with the Service for which they are to apply. These special conditions shall be deemed to be part of these T&C and they shall prevail over the T&C in the event of any conflict.</p>

        <p>Capacity. Any use of the Website or the Application implies acceptance of and compliance with all the terms of these T&C. By using the Services and entering into these Terms, the User/Client acknowledges to be at least 18 years old and to have the right, authority and capacity to enter into any agreement with META LEGENDS under the law of their country or declares to represent, by virtue of a valid mandate, the person for whom they are entering into a contract.</p>

        <p>Acceptance of the T&C. The User declares to have read the T&C and to have accepted them before any Transaction, which implies unreserved acceptance of these T&C. By this acceptance, the User acknowledges that, prior to any Transaction, they have received sufficient information and advice from META LEGENDS through the Website, allowing them to ensure that the content of the Transaction meets their needs. Unless proven otherwise, the data recorded by the Website constitutes proof of all the facts, acceptance and transactions.</p>

        <p>The User may request a copy of the version of the T&C applicable to their Transaction at any time. The failure in any one or more instances by META LEGENDS to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the T&C, to exercise any right or privilege in the T&C conferred shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges.</p>

        <h2 className="title-with-gradient">3 EVOLUTION OF THE T&C</h2>

        <p>META LEGENDS reserves the right to amend or supplement the T&C at any time and without notice. Any change in the T&C will be reported by the update of the “last updated” date above associated with the updated Terms. The modifications to the T&C made by META LEGENDS will apply immediately to Transactions placed after their modification but will not apply to the Transactions already completed, except for the clauses related to the technical evolution of the Website or the Application, as long as these modifications do not involve a price raise or an alteration of the quality or the characteristics having conditioned the commitment of the User or the Client.</p>

        <p>If META LEGENDS is unable to perform the Service under the conditions accepted by the Client at the time of the Transaction, the Client has the right to request the termination of the Contract and the refund of the Transaction.</p>

        <h2 className="title-with-gradient">4 SERVICE DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>META LEGENDS provides a Service allowing the purchase of NFTs by its Clients on <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/">https://opensea.io/</a>, through the Website: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meta-legends.com/">https://www.meta-legends.com/</a>. NFTs are part of a collection of 12345 digital artwork pieces, distributed as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS (the interplanetary file system).</p>

      <p>The Client is expressly informed that the NFTs offered on the Website are exclusively sold through third-party websites (in particular: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/">https://opensea.io/</a>) to which the Website refers. These websites are administered by third parties and META LEGENDS exercises no control over them. These websites apply their own terms of use (in the case of Opensea, see: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io/tos">https://opensea.io/tos</a>) which they may also modify at any time. Before purchasing a NFT, the Client acknowledges that they have reviewed its essential characteristics as well as its price, which are described in detail on: <a target="_blank" href="https://opensea.io">https://opensea.io</a>.</p>

        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY META LEGENDS ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT CAN META LEGENDS BE HELD LIABLE FOR DIRECT OR INDIRECT, MATERIAL OR IMMATERIAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY UNAVAILABILITY OR MALFUNCTION OF THE WEBSITE OR OF THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.</p>

        <h2 className="title-with-gradient">5 NFT OWNERSHIP</h2>

        <p>Digital artwork ownership. The purchase of a META LEGENDS NFT by the Client implies transfer of ownership of the digital artwork to which it is associated and which is distributed as a non-fungible token on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

        <p>The Client may in turn sell the NFT at the price they determine (to which a commission of 5% of the selling price to be paid by the buyer will be added). The ownership of the NFT is ruled by a smart contract and the Ethereum network terms. META LEGENDS has no ability to cancel, reverse or otherwise modify any Transaction or ownership title once the Transaction has been completed.</p>

        <p>License. The purchase of the NFT grants the Client a worldwide non-exclusive license to reproduce and represent the acquired NFT, for personal and commercial purposes (use on social networks, in particular as an avatar or profile photo, creation of derivative products...).</p>

        <p>This license terminates when the licensee loses ownership of the NFT. The resale of the NFT to a third party entails the transfer of this license to the latter.</p>

        <p>In any case, this license only applies to the NFT owned by the licensee and not to other NFTs from the collection or to any other element developed by META LEGENDS (including, without being limited to: texts, graphics, logos, software or any metaverse component).</p>
        <p>It is explicitly stated here that META LEGENDS reserves the right, in any case, to represent or reproduce each of the NFTs of the collection. This includes commercial, advertising and promotional use, in any medium (including physical or digital), throughout the world and without limitation of time.</p>

        <h2 className="title-with-gradient">6 CLIENT AND USER’S OBLIGATIONS</h2>
